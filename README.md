## Motivation

*When diving into <a href="http://www.manifold.net/" target="_blank">Manifolds website</a> or <a href="http://www.georeference.org/" target="_blank">official community</a> do you feel a bit lost when trying to start?*

If so, probably this guide is for you, although it won't cover all Manifold possible features, because it depends on how you use it. For example, you can use it to edit geospatial data or even as a API without GUI helping you develop custom applications.

In the past there where other Manifold GIS resources, but with time they got outdated and eventually taken offline. By building this guide as a GitHub repo it saves time for creating original content. 

Please also take into count this guide won't replace the need to consult the original Manifold GIS <a href="http://www.georeference.org/doc/manifold.htm" target="_blank">user manual</a> or resources referred throughout the guide.

## Any help is appreciated

While diving into the content, you can also create a guide for a topic not covered at the moment, here are the easiest ways to contribute:

1. **Update Guides.** Review existing guides and update outdated content, add troubleshooting tips or add/update images.
2. **Fill Out Guides.** Find guides that are *simply stubs* and fill them out with content.
3. **Create New Guides.** Review the *missing topics list* and create new topic guides.

There will be a page with a *master missing topics list* that contains some missing topics or the ones marked as **Needs Attention**. Before contributing, it's always useful to check the [issues](https://github.com/Spatialmentor/Using-Manifold-GIS-for-beginners/issues).

If you are interested in contributing to our guides, please check out our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Spatialmentor/Using-Manifold-GIS-for-beginners/wiki/Contributing-Guidelines) first.
